#sprklst - An undefined project to make Sparklists public, collaborative, and forkable.#

##What's a sparklist?
A sparklist is a place to keep all the ideas you have.

##What's sprklst?
Sprklst is a project to make a personal sparklist more valuable - making your ideas public, allowing collaboration, and forking. It's a bit like Git for ideas.
