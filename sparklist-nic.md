Agency mobile client dashboard - google alerts, stock price, category trends, everything you need to know what's going on in the life of your client.

A personal analytics dashboard that shows me the things I want to know - how many people have used one oy my apps, visitors to my blog, listens on soundcloud, over the last 24hrs etc. 

As above, extended to hardware indicators.

The byte switch. A light switch in your house where you turn off Facebook, or twitter, or email. It hooks in to your router.

BrandUnfollow - login with twitter and Facebook and we'll show you all the brands you can unfollow.

A better nbews-reading and discovery app. News discovery is about algorithmic convergence - nothing diverges. So create something that does a good job of showing me 90% content that's bang on - but 10% content that challenges me.

Music discovery on soundcloud by analysing who an artist follows. Then look at frequency, number of plays, and number of other connection of each artist. Present in a nice way that allows you to listen to their most popular track (under 15min to avoid sets)

Connects users to brands. Permission based. Not tracking, not targeting. Invitations. Frequent Flyers for online data.

MishMash - something for storing data points. When you come across cool stats you add them. Make it searchable, make it social/accessible. Sources are imperitive.


Tinder for businesses. Every person, their start date, team, position, extension, email, and mobile. Self reporting - if the person has quit you hit a button and the admin gets an email. If the persons details are wrong you can report them as wrong. Anyone can edit a persons details (except their email address), and the changes aren't applied until the person clicks an approve link in a confirmation email.

3D Printed clock (preferably in transparent acryclic)

Hyedisms - Tweets of Karl Hyde lyrics.

Personal data project - a way to collect and store your personal analytics. Safely and securely and on open source code and/or hardware. Why? I'm not sure yet, but when I work it out, I want the historical data

SubCredit - a Visa card that you use for your subscriptions. Any monthly subscription (hosting, app.io, sound cloud etc.) you use your SubCredit card to pay. We email you monthly to remind you what you're subscribed to, and offering better deals. We make money through affiliate deals, groups deals, and because we're a credit card. Visualisation is key to this idea.

Alerts for Hacker News based on N upvotes and a keyword of X in the headline/comments

Twitter follower tool. Based on my followers followers. It would  show my their recent tweets so I could favourite them, and remove after a while if I want. Also add ability to retweet/favourite recent tweets (RT/Fave is a quiet 'hello')
